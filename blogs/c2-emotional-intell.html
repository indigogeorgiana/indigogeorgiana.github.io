          <h3>What learnings did you take from chapter one?</h3> 
        </center>
        <p>Before reading the chapter I decided to speed read through the forewords of Daniel      Goleman and Jon Kabat-Zin hoping that it would be beneficial to gain some insight.      From the foreword alone I had a breif understanding of what the book was about.
        </p>    
        <p>After reading the first chapter of the book my interest was sparked and I wanted to     continue reading. Seriously, the authors and collaborators of this book were really     on to something good. Combined with the research they had noted and collected the       concept behind their teachings appeared sound. It blew my mind in more ways than one.
        </p>
        <p>Personally, I like to think of my self as a somewhat well-read person, but after        just one chapter of this book, I realized how much more there was for me to learn.      In short, it opened my eyes to the science of neuroplasticity from a different angle.
        </p> 
        <p>Then I remembered something someone had said to me the other day, and I quote           <em>"the brain needs more space than we give it. But life is fleeting, and sometimes    it's hard to force it to shut up."</em> With that small nugget of wisdom bouncing       around inside my head for the next couple days it began to reasonate with me more as    I read through this book.  Feeling inspired about the possibilities of what 
           this book could potentially teach me I began jotting down a little list of some of the benefits others had gained through their own experience.
        </p>
      </div>
    <div class="">
  <h3>
    <b>
      List of possible benefits:
    </b>
  </h3>
  <center>
    <ul>
      <ol>An increased level of emotional intelligence</ol>
      <ol>The ability to perceive mental and emtional processes with more clarity</ol>
      <ol>Aid in better concentration, clarity and awareness</ol>
      <ol>A greater self-confidence, self-mastery- (to see myself more clearly and kindly)</ol>
      <ol>Improved family communication</ol>
      <ol>The skill to calm yourself on demand</ol>
      <ol>Develop a more focussed sense of optimism and resilience</ol>
      <ol>Create useful mental habits</ol>
      <ol>Learn to uncover your ideal future</ol>
      <ol>Master motivation - emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals</ol>
    </ul>
  </center>  
  <div class="">    
    <p><b>Instant lightbulb moment!</b> Almost immediately I realized that all of these             benefits could eventually over-flow into other areas of my life. My brain quickly           calculated the logic and of what I had read, either the writer was a really good sales      person, or they spoke the truth through their own experience at Google. Yes, Google,        with a estimated brand value of $245 billion, the same Google who's search engine           millions, including myself used on a daily basis. The very same Google where hordes of      Web Dev Wannabe's flock to and aspire to work. There was absolutely no doubt this was       something for me to explore further. Career changing, life altering, if I did indeed        embraced the teachings inside this book. I thought more about my life, I Knew I was on      to a good with Enspiral Dev Academy, when I completed my learning and promote myself        into this new career, path what then? What else could I do to better my life, my family     and my people. Then I thought about the community aspect going a bit further than           myself. Having connected with Habitat for Humanity already, believing in their cause        before hand I hopep this could be the way I could geniuinely give back to my community.

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>This was officially my first attempt at any type of mediation, two minutes of             silencing my mind and <em>just being.</em> The notion seemed somewhat foreign, then I     took another look at the list I had written out. So, I checked the time before closing    my eyes. At first, it was kind of hard at trying to turn off my thoughts but I            focussing on just breathing, blocking out the world outside. And the author of the        book had warned, <em> when my mind went off track, bring yourself back gently.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>When I did eventually open my eyes, I had spent almost seven minutes focussing on that 
         one thing, breathing and just being. From my own experience, I found meditation/mindfulness simple and at first a little difficult. I can only imagine how much discipline a person who meditates daily manages this skill. I understand more about the benefits that can be gained from devoting just two minutes a day to mindfulness.
