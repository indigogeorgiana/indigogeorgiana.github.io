        <p>
          In the weeks leading up to this chapter I have used the informal practice of empathetic listening
          on several occassions in my household. I am known within the household as the peace keeper on 
          occassion I have had to make the call to resolve incidents. Which involes listening to both sides 
          of an argument, then of course working out how to solve it. This means calmly talking through 
          the problem from each persons perspective then compromising. I often deploy this technique, 
          to highlight a persons strengths, it makes people feel good about themselves. It may not 100%
          be the technique described but was the only type of instance I could come up with where geniuine
          and positive praise was used recently.

        How did you find the loving kindness meditation?

    </h3>
      <p>
        It was good to have to extend praise, kindness out to loved ones. Up until now a lot of the 
        meditation has been about self, which of course is good for self care as that is important.
        But it was also nice to take the time thinking of others and their lives and extending empathy 
        to a loved one.

        1. Think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or 
        disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.

        I am by no means a radical green peace activist but I believe in reducing waste where ever I am able 
        and know that I can improve on reducing my own and my families carbon footprint. However, most 
        recently a topic that has been close to my heart is the environment and the effects humans as a 
        species has on mother earth. Several weeks back now there was a post on Channel 4 News face book 
        page about Faroe island life and annual mass hunt of pilot whales. It was filmed from an outsiders len's, 
        not demonizing their way of life. Which in my personal opinion the best way to views on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
      2 Describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in 
      writing or by talking about it in a monologue.
    </p>
      <p>
        When I first layed my eyes on the video and the hunt, at first I felt anger. As I would like
        seeing Donald Triumphs son proudly displaying his hunting trophies of lion's and other animals in 
        South Africa. It made me sick. I remember sitting with that rage for a while watching and wondering
        as Pamela Anderson said on that very piece of documentary footage. "Why do you need to kill whales?"
        Then, secondly honestly my eyes welled up I could not believe like the Japanese whom slaughter 
        and have been allowed to do for so long. This is not right, this should not be allowed any longer.
        I began searching through the comments and found alot of different points of view.
        I choose to reply with something less upsetting and hateful. "It might be a way of life for these 
        people. It may even be tradition. Regardless there has to be a point where we as a people 
        recognize how much irreversible damage we each cause to the food chain. Thus affecting the 
        generations after us. What kind of world are we leaving behind?"
      </p> 
      <p>
        3. Now describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 
        percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue.
      </p>
      <p>
        This documentary is going to be a must watch for me. On the other side of the argument, the islanders 
        that live on this island live off what they can catch where ever possible. Choosing to reduce the 
        amount of processed or store brought food. For them it is how they have always lived. The doctor
        that takes care of the Faroes has recently seen an increase in mercury and plastic containimenants 
        over recent years and the islanders are noticing the effects. Are they too feeling a sense of loss 
        in their on traditions? How will they go to survive with the noticable environmental changes? 
        They too will eventually the feelings of loss, how will some of these families survive 
        the changes to the earth? 
        The more I ventured into the video I found that the video was not entirely about the hunt but 
        about a way of life to the environment far more intimate than what I had thought, it did make me 
        see things from another point of view.
