      <h3>
        <strong>
          Blocked on a coding problem? Explain how you solved the problem?
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          This week, Sprint 5 was the first time I really came up against a major problem and becameThe Fizz Buzz exercise outlined 
          building my code for the Fizz Buzz exercise I put together the required elements and variables 
          for Sprint 5. I began typing out another set of code knowing there could possibly be many 
          other methods. Searching through my code I found no problems that I could discern as a fault. 
          However after running the code I received a "syntax error: missing var."
        </p> 
  
      <h3>
        <strong>
        First Method Used: Reading error messages
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          Firstly, following the syntax error I searched through my code attempting to check if anything was
          missing and how I could possibly to solve the problem. However, everytime I attempted to fix 
          the error I continued to receive other syntax errors as I attempted a process of elimination. 
        </p>

      <h3>
        <strong>
          Second Method Used: Googling
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          When the above did not work I then copied the syntax error into the Google search to see what else 
          I could learn. My way of thinking was the more I learnt about an error the better equipt I could be
          to solving the problem.
        </p>                             
 
      <h3><strong>What did you learn?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          In Sprint 5 I learned a lot about myself and how I handle problem solivng my code. While most 
          times I get through any coding issue relatively okay, I found by doing this weeks blog that I 
          need to deploy a more refined method and a far better system to approach problem solving. One 
          that works better for myself given my knowledge and capabilities.
        </p>

      <h2>
        <strong>
          Problem Solving Techniques
        </strong>
      </h2> 
    </center> 

    <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
      <p>
        Pseudocode, is a good method for keeping your code organised making it easier for everyone to read. 
        It's also a good way of noting each piece of your code, keeping track of what you are trying to
        achieve.
      </p>

      <h3>Trying something/ Rubber ducky</h3> 
        <p>
          I have not yet used either of these methods. But I will work my way through in the next sprint or 
          when I get blocked again.
        </p>

      <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
          Reading error messages can be quite difficult, especially if the error messages specificity can be too
          exact. I have had some trouble working out what or where the real problem is within the syntax. 
          Example of this is when I received a error missing a closing bracket. After looking through the 
          code I found no missing brackets, so I need a greater understanding of what the error message 
          is actually complaining about.
        </p>
 
      <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
          Having used console log() throught out Sprint 4 and 5 I can honestly admit that being able to 
          utilize this for debugging purposes to display data from my exercise programs.
        </p>

      <h3>
        <strong>
          Googling
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          Google is such a wealthy source to search for practically anything. So, it is not surprise that
          this is a very valuable source to learn about javascript, problem solving. I have found 
          stack overflow very helpful when researching different snipplets of code. Also using w3schools.com 
          that laysout syntax, methods, elements and other properties is some cases showing the way the code 
          is used.
        </p>

      <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
          During phase zero I have asked for help a couple of times and had a great response. I have reached
          out to others for support and asked for help with my website but as I am not in Auckland at 
          present pairing has become a bit hard. Added to this is the fact that all my peers are also
          learning and I don't wish to take time away from their own learning. Going into the next phase I 
          will be able to be face to face with my fellow students making pairing alot easier. 
        </p>
  
      <h3>
        <strong>
          Asking coaches for help
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          Asking for help from our academy coaches has been quiet efficient, when I have had any problems
          they have answered all my questions. Also I have received some really good advice that has made 
          me alter how I approach my work.
        </p>

      <h3>
        <strong>
          How confident are you using the problem solving techniques? How did you feel throughout the 
          process?
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
          Having always enjoyed a challenge it is a large part of what keeps my mind learning. I like the 
          idea of having to work out a puzzle. I am not one hundred percent confident with all of the 
          problem solving techniques.
        </p>
 
      <h3>
        <strong>
          Improving your process with reflection
        </strong>
      </h3>                  
        <p>
          Personally I found this weeks exercises more challenging and I spent more time than was needed on 
          them because I found them challenging. What I have learned about myself this week in respects to
          problem solving and how I debug programs. My problem solving method has up until this week has
          remained un-refined. Having to work through this blog and these exercises I realise the importance of
          deploying a better more organised approach. I hope that this will help reduce the amount of time I 
          spend on any exercise.
