        <h3>Compassionate</h3>
        <p>
          I have had several years on this earth learning and although I thought myself to be 
          naturally compassionate. This skill can sometimes be difficult to maintain and from 
          my understanding mindfulness has help me to understand myself and better control my 
          emotions. Through my journey of mindfulness I have taken to the time to center myself
          and everything I have experienced up until now has been beneficial.
        </p>
        <h3>Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          Having worked in a few leadership roles in the past I can certainly understand being 
          compassionate, through cognitive, affective and motivational is an important valuable 
          skill to master. I learned alot things about myself while in these work roles
          about relating to other people as well as ensuring I thought about what 
          I said and how it would affect others.

        Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?
      </strong>
    </h3>
      <p>
        Everytime I meditate I enjoy the experience more, so after this exercise I knew I would 
        feel great. It was a struggle to think of everyone as good because I have long known it a
        character flaw of mine and it has got into trouble many times. Thinking about goodness and 
        everyone being good, when I knew this to be false. I found it was a challenege, so I had 
        to say it aloud.

      </h3>
        <p>
          From the perspective of a mountain the experience was illuminating and different. Taking 
          in negativity and thinking about it. However, exhaling it all out was easy and far more relieving. 
          Using visualisation is not a new concept. After watching another channel four story last week 
          about the crisis in Myanmar so imagine human suffering and pain was manageable to understand.
          In return  having alot of positive quotes around the house and keep a vision board that I 
          assess and look at often. What I learned was taking on negative thought was only made easy
          because I knew it would end in positive thoughts.

        How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?

      <p>
        Status, - I believe the completion of this course will open new doors to new career. I have also
        found it feels good to tell friends and family about this exciting new career path.
      <p> 
        Certainty - As the chapter suggests, <em>uncertainty generates “error responses” in the brain that 
        cannot be ignored until they are resolved.</em> My main fear is that I would not remember the 
        knowledge and I knew that I could not retain it all. My certainty came from knowing that I would
        learn more as I went through the process and I have accepted this as apart of my learning process.
      </p> 
      <p> 
        Autonomy - There were countless times when I felt helpless and lost. I felt this was apart of the
        learning process for me. To understand how I manage stress and trouble shoot through it and come out
        the otherside wiser.
      </p> 
      <p>  
        Relatedness - It was great being able to connect with other students at EDA. I did relate well with
        others as we shared each others experiece. This made me feel at ease knowwing other students had
        experience some of the same emotions and concerns. 
      </p>
        <p> 
        Fairness - I strongly believe that although I disapline with fairness, I have alway believed also
        that sometimes life is not unfair. Through my lifetime I have learned to endure some hardships 
        as I am sure we all have. This has made me more resilent and tolerant.

        I recently had to make a call I was not looking forward to making. I knew the discussion was going
        to be very difficult. After running through the conversation through my head several times and I felt
        prepared. Once I was ready and careful with the words I used and offered my thanks when the other 
        person replied. I was happy when the situation was resolved and apologies were shared all around. 
        Peace was again restored.
