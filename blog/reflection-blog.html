                        <br></br>
                 
                        <div class="h2"><strong>What is my take on the DBA/EDA experience?</strong></div>
                          <p>Pretty full on up front, there is a lot to remember and take in. With the various bookmarks, apps and links one could be forgiven for getting lost.
                             I have asked poor Harrison and Jack so many questions feeling somewhat unsure how to proceed, but I have in many circumstances found the answers for myself 
                             very quickly found the answer to the myself the more I explore. Having had some exposure to code some of the programming and coding practices in the past I have found this somewhat beneficial.</p>
                
                        <div class="h2"><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></div>
                          <p>I love how open everyone is, and am very impressed with how the Dev Academy has embraced diversity. And the IKE - Integrity, Kindness, Effort.</p>
        
                        <div class="h2"><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></div>
                          <p>To know that my study and work environment is going to be engaging, open and regardless of any of my own fears I will be working with an awesome bunch of people.</p>
         
                        <div class="h2"><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</strong></div>
                          <p>Honestly, coming into Dev Academy I had no intial pre-concieved notions of what to expect. I enjoy comfort of being supported remotely, I had been worried about how I would manage but all that has been put to rest by the support of Dougal, Jack and knowing that help is available on slack. Slack has defintely made the transition into remote study relatively easy.</p>
         
                        <div class= "h2"><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</strong></div>
                          <p>Definitely will be a challenge.</p>
               
                        <div class="h2"><strong>Does it make you nervous?</strong></div>
                          <p>Absolutely not it makes me hopeful and positive moving forward.</p>
