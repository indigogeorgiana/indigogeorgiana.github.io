      Attention Training
 
      Attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities. 
      The idea is to train attention to create a quality of mind that is calm and clear at the same time. 
      That quality of mind forms the foundation for emotional intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery
 
      Use your trained attention to create high-resolution perception into your own cognitive and 
      emotive processes. With that, you become able to observe your thought stream and the process 
      of emotion with high clarity, and to do so objectively from a third-person perspective. 
      Once you can do that, you create the type of deep self-knowledge that eventually enables 
      self-mastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creating Useful Mental Habits
 
      Imagine whenever you meet anybody, your habitual, instinctive first thought is, I wish for 
      this person to be happy. Having such habits changes everything at work, because this sincere 
      goodwill is picked up unconsciously by others, and you create the type of trust that leads to 
      highly productive collaborations. Such habits can be volitionally trained.

      Emotional intelligence is classified into five domains:
 
      1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of one’s internal states, preferences, resources, and intuitions
      2. Self-regulation: Management of one’s internal states, impulses, and resources
      3. Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals
      4. Empathy: Awareness of others’ feelings, needs, and concerns
      5. Social skills: Adeptness at inducing desirable responses in others

  Chapter 2: The Theory and Practice of Mindfulness Meditation
</h3>

</center>    
    <p>
      The seven-point meditation postures are:
      
      1. Back straight “like an arrow” 
      2. Legs crossed in “lotus position” 
      3. Shoulders relaxed, held up and back, “like a vulture” 
      4. Chin tucked in slightly, “like an iron hook” 
      5. Eyes closed or gazing into space   
      6. Tongue held against the upper palate
      7. Lips slightly apart, teeth not clenched
 
    </p>
      <p>
          Often in our meditation, we get distracted by sounds, thoughts, or physical sensations. 
          I suggest a four-step plan to work with such distractions:
 
          1. Acknowledge.
          2. Experience without judging or reacting. 
          3. If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness. 
          4. Let it go.

          MINDFULNESS MEDITATION
 
          Let us begin by sitting comfortably. Sit in a position that enables you to be both relaxed 
          and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you. Or, if you prefer, you may sit like 
          a majestic mountain, whatever that means to you.
          Let us now take three slow, deep breaths to inject both energy and relaxation into our practice.
          Now, let us breathe naturally and bring a very gentle attention to your breath. You can either 
          bring attention to the nostrils, the abdomen, or the entire body of breath, whatever that means 
          to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.
          (Short pause)
          If you like, you can think of this exercise as resting the mind on the breath. You can visualize 
          the breath to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it, very 
          gently. Just be.
          (Long pause)
          If at any time you feel distracted by a sensation, thought, or sound, just acknowledge it, 
          experience it, and very gently let it go. Bring your attention very gently back to the breathing.
          (Long pause)
          If you like, let us end this meditation by inviting joyful inner peace to arise.
          Breathing in, I am calm.
          Breathing out, I smile.
          This present moment,
          Wonderful.
          (Short pause)
          Thank you for your attention.

          Chapter 3 - Extending the Benefits of Mindfulness beyond Sitting
      </strong>
    </h3>
      <p>
          In General, Generalize Mindfulness
 
          One of the most important things a mindfulness meditator needs to do is extend the benefits of 
          mindfulness beyond sitting into every part of life. During sitting meditation, you may experience 
          some degree of calmness, clarity, and happiness, and the challenge is to generalize that mind 
          into life situations outside formal sitting meditation.
      </p>
      <p>
          Mindfulness in Activity
 
          The best place to practice mindfulness is in daily life. Once you are able to bring 
          mindfulness into every moment of daily life, your quality of life may change dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Form of Mindfulness:
        Walking Meditation
        Formal Practice of Mindful listening
        Informal Practice of Mindful Llistening
        Mindful Conversation

        Sustain your practice

        Ask yourself these questions everyweek:
        How am I doing with my commitment to my practice?
        What has arisen in my life that relates to my practice?
      </p>
      <p>
          MEDITATION CIRCUIT TRAINING
 
          Let us begin by sitting comfortably in a position that enables you to be both relaxed 
          and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you.
          Let us rest the mind. If you like, you can visualize the breath to be a resting place, 
          or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it.
          (Short pause)
          Let us shift into focused attention. Bring your attention to your breath, or any other object 
          of meditation you choose. Let this attention be stable like a rock, undisturbed by any distraction. 
          If the mind is distracted, gently but firmly bring the mind back. Let’s continue this exercise for 
          the remainder of 3 minutes.
          (Long pause)
          Now we shift into open attention. Bring your attention to whatever you experience and whatever 
          comes to mind. Let this attention be flexible like grass moving in the wind. In this mind, there 
          is no such thing as a distraction. Every object you experience is an object of meditation. 
          Everything is fair game. Let us continue this exercise for the remainder of 3 minutes.
          (Long pause)
          (Shift to focused attention for 3 minutes. Then shift to open attention for 3 minutes.)
          Let us end this sitting by resting the mind. If you like, you can again visualize the breath 
          to be a resting place, or a cushion, or a mattress, and let the mind rest on it.
          (Long pause)
          Thank you for your attention.

      <strong>
          Chapter 4 -Self-Awareness That Leads to Self-Confidence 
      </strong>
    </h3>
      <p>
          Clarity
          This chapter is about looking within ourselves. If the whole chapter can be encapsulated in a 
          single word, that word is clarity. Deepening self-awareness is about developing clarity within 
          oneself. There are two specific qualities we like to develop—resolution and vividness—as 
          illustrated by the pictures above.
      </p> 
      <p>
          Self-Awareness Competencies

          1. Emotional awareness: Recognizing one’s emotions and their effects
          2. Accurate self-assessment: Knowing one’s strengths and limits 
          3. Self-confidence: A strong sense of one’s self-worth and capabilities
 
          The key difference between emotional awareness and accurate self-assessment is that 
          the former operates mostly at the level of physiology and the latter operates mostly at 
          the level of meaning. Emotional awareness is my accurately perceiving emotions in my 
          body, knowing where they come from, and understanding how they affect my behavior. 
          Accurate self-assessment, in contrast, goes beyond the emotions I feel and includes 
          knowledge into myself as a human being. It asks questions like: What are my strengths 
          and weaknesses? What are my resources and limitations? What matters to me? Accurate 
          self-assessment builds on emotional awareness.
      </p> 
      <p>
          From Emotional Awareness to Self-Confidence
 
          An easy way to get an injection of self-confidence is to attend a motivational speech where 
          some guy speaking perfect English without my funny accent shouts at you and tells you how 
          great you are, “You can succeed! You are great! You can do it!” 
      </p> 
      <p>
          BODY SCAN
 
          Settling Attention
           
          Let us begin by sitting comfortably for 2 minutes. Sit in a position that enables you to be 
          both relaxed and alert at the same time, whatever that means to you.
          Now, let us breathe naturally and bring very gentle attention to the breath. You can either 
          bring attention to the nostrils, the abdomen, or the entire body of breath, whatever that 
          means to you. Become aware of in breath, out breath, and space in between.

          Scan Body
 
          Head
 
          Now bring your attention to the top of your head, ears, and back of your head. Notice 
          sensations, or lack of sensations, for 1 minute.

          Face
 
          Now move your attention to your face. Your forehead, eyes, cheeks, nose, lips, mouth, and 
          inside of your mouth (gums, tongue) for 1 minute.

          Neck and Shoulders
 
          Move your attention to your neck, the inside of your throat, and your shoulders for 1 minute.

          Back
 
          Move your attention to your lower back, mid back, and upper back for 1 minute. The back carries 
          a lot of our load and stores a lot of our ten.sion. So let us give our backs the kind and loving 
          attention they deserve.

          Front
           
          Now move your attention to the chest and stomach for 1 minute. If it is possible for you, try 
          to bring attention to your internal organs, whatever that means to you.

          Entire Body at Once
           
          And now, bring your attention to your entire body all at once for 1 minute.

          Scan for Emotion
           
          Did you find any emotion in your body? If there is any, just notice its presence in the body. 
          If not, just notice the absence of emotions, and catch one if it arises in the next 2 minutes.

          Positive Emotion

          Let us now try to experience a positive emotion in the body.

          Bring to mind a memory of a happy, joyous event or a time when you were optimal and productive 
          or a time when you felt confident. Experience the feeling of positive emotion. Now, bring your 
          attention to your body. What does that positive emotion feel like in the body? In the face? Neck, 
          hest, back? How are you breathing? Any difference in level of tension? Let us just experience it 
          for 3 minutes.

          Returning to Grounding
          
          Let us now return to the present. If you find an emotionally charged thought, just let it go.
          Bring your attention to either your body or your breath, whichever your mind finds more stability 
          in. And let’s just settle the mind there for 2 minutes.
          (Long pause)
          Thank you for your attention.
      </p> 
      <p>
          Journaling

          Journaling is the practice of self-discovery by writing to yourself. It is an important exercise 
          to help you discover what is in your mind that is not in a clear, conscious view. Usually, when 
          we write, we are trying to communicate a thought with another person. This exercise is different. 
          You’re not trying to communicate with somebody else. Instead, you are trying to let your thoughts 
          flow onto paper so you can see what comes up.

          The exercise itself is very simple. You give yourself a certain amount of time, say, three minutes,
          and you are given (or you give yourself) a prompt, which for our purposes is an open-ended sentence 
          such as “What I am feeling now is…” For those three minutes, write down whatever comes to mind. 
          You may write about the prompt, or you may write about anything else that comes to mind. Try 
          not to think about what you’re going to write—just write. It does not matter how closely you 
          follow the prompt; just let all your thoughts flow onto the paper. There is only one rule: 
          do not stop writing until your time is up.
          Here are some suggested prompts:
 
                    • What I am feeling now is…
                    
                    • I am aware that…
                    
                    • What motivates me is…
                    
                    • I am inspired by…
                    
                    • Today, I aspire to…
                    
                    • What hurts me is…
                    
                    • I wish…
                    
                    • Others are…
                    
                    • I made a happy mistake…
                    
                    • Love is…
      </p>
      <p>
          My Emotions Are Not Me
 
          As we deepen our self-awareness, we eventually arrive at a very important key insight: we are 
          not our emotions. We usually think of our emotions as being us. This is reflected in the 
          language we use to describe them. For example, we say, “I am angry” or “I am happy” or 
          “I am sad,” as if anger, happiness, or sadness are us, or become who we are. To the mind, 
          our emotions become our very existence.

          Chapter 5 -Developing Self-Mastery
      </strong>
    </h3>
      <p>
          About Self-Regulation
          Five emotional competencies under the domain of self-regulation:
 
          1. Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check
          
          2. Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity
          
          3. Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance
          
          4. Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change
          
          5. Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information
      </p>
      <p>
          General Principles for Dealing with Distress
 
          Four very helpful general principles for dealing with any distressing emotions are:
           
          1. Know when you are not in pain.
           
          2. Do not feel bad about feeling bad.
           
          3. Do not feed the monsters.
           
          4. Start every thought with kindness and humor.
      </p>
      <p>
          Dealing with Triggers
 
          One common situation in which self-regulation skills really come in handy is when we get 
          triggered. 
          The first step in learning to deal with triggers is identifying when you have been triggered. 
          Executive coach Marc Lesser provided these helpful suggestions on things to look out for:
          • Body: Shallow breathing, rapid heartbeat, and sick to the stomach
          • Emotions: Experiencing a flight-or-flight response, either feeling like a “deer in head
            lights” or having an emotional outburst (what Goleman famously calls an “amygdala hijack”)
          • Thoughts: Feeling like a victim, thoughts of blame and judgment, difficulty paying attention

      </p>
      <p>
          Siberian North Railroad
 
          Here is a practice called the Siberian North Railroad for dealing with triggers. 
          This is a useful practice not only for triggers but also for other situations in which we 
          need to deal with negative or distressing emotions.

          The practice has five steps: 

          1. Stop 
          2. Breathe          
          3. Notice          
          4. Reflect          
          5. Respond

          Think about these statements:
 
          • Everybody wants to be happy. 
          • This person thinks acting this way will make him happy, in some way.

          Describe a situation when you were triggered:
 
          1. What was the event?
          
          2. What were the feelings that arose? What was the very first feeling—anger, retreat?
          
          3. Where in your body did you feel it / do you feel it now?
      </p>
      <p>
          SIBERIAN NORTH RAILROAD

          Settling Attention
 
          Start with 3 deep breaths.
          Bring gentle awareness to the breathing. Bring attention to the in and out breaths, and the 
          spaces in between.

          Negative Emotion
          
          Let’s now shift gears into a negative emotion for 2 minutes.
          Bring to mind a memory of an unhappy event, an experience of frustration, anger, or hurt, or an 
          experience in which you were triggered. See if you can relive the event and the associated 
          emotions in your mind.

          Managing Negative Emotion
          
          Let us now mentally practice our response strategy for 7 minutes.
          The first two steps are to stop and breathe. Stopping at the onset of a trigger is the sacred 
          pause. Let us reinforce the pause by focusing the mind on the breath, and not reacting to the 
          emotion. If you want, you may try taking slow, deep breaths. And let’s stay in this state of 
          pause for another 30 seconds.
          (30-second pause)
          The next step is to notice. We notice by experiencing the emotion in the body. Bring your 
          attention to your body. What does an afflictive emotion feel like in the body? In the face? 
          Neck, shoulders, chest, back? Notice any difference in level of tension or temperature.
          Experience it without judging. What is most important at this point is to try to experience 
          emotional difficulty simply as a physiological phenomenon, not an existential phenomenon. 
          For example, the experience is not “I am angry.” It is “I experience anger in my body.”
          Let’s take a minute to experience the physiology of emotion in the body.

          (60-second pause)
          Now we reflect.
          Where is the emotion coming from? Is there a history behind it?
          (30-second pause)
          Now we respond.
          Bring to mind ways in which you might respond to this situation that would have a positive 
          outcome. You do not actually have to do it—just imagine the kindest, most positive response. 
          What would that look like? Let’s spend the next minute or so creating that response.
          (60-second pause) - then return to grounding.
          
          From Self-Regulation to Self-Confidence
 
          Whenever we experience unpleasant emotions, our first instinct is aversion. We do not want 
          these unpleasant feelings; we want them to go away. As a result of this aversion, we shift 
          our thoughts externally toward the other person or environment instead of toward ourselves. 
          For example, when we feel hurt, our thoughts are dominated by how awful the other person is, 
          all because we want to avoid experiencing unpleasant emotions. This process is usually 
          unconscious to most of us.
                     
        </p>
        <p>
            Making Friends with Emotions
 
            Ultimately, self-regulation is about making friends with our emotions. All the practices and 
            techniques mentioned in this chapter—the Siberian North Railroad, not feeding monsters, 
            seeing positives in triggers, and so on—point toward befriending our emotions.

      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Pleasure, Passion, and Higher Purpose

        three types of happiness: pleasure, passion, and higher purpose.1

        1. Pleasure: This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star 
        type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a 
        rock star.
        2. Passion: Also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.
        3. Higher Purpose: This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Motivation in Three Easy Steps

        In this chapter, we will introduce three practices for motivation:
        1. Alignment: Aligning our work with our values and higher purpose
        2. Envisioning: Seeing the desired future for ourselves
        3. Resilience: The ability to overcome obstacles in our path
 
        Combined, we hope these practices constitute a complete package of tools to help you find 
        out how you want your life to unfold and to navigate the path to get there.
         
    </p>
    <p>
        Alignment
    
        Having Fun for a Living
        
        Alignment means aligning our work with our values and higher purpose.
        Work of this nature has at least one of these two qualities, very often both:
 
        1. The work is deeply meaningful to you
        2. It generates a state of flow in you


        Flow 
        Flow occurs when the task at hand matches the skill level of the practitioner, such that it is 
        difficult enough to provide a challenge but not so difficult that it overwhelms the practitioner. 
        If the task is too easy relative to skill level, the practitioner will be bored or apathetic. 
        In contrast, if it is too difficult, the practitioner becomes anxious or worried. Flow occurs 
        when difficulty is just right.
        Flow is a state of focused attention, so people skillful in focusing their attention, such as 
        meditators or martial arts experts, are more likely to find themselves in flow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Autonomy, Mastery, Purpose
        The three elements of true motivation are:
 
        1. Autonomy: The urge to direct our own lives
        2. Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that matters 
        3. Purpose: The yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves 

        Know and Align Thyself
 
        Alignment is built upon self-awareness. When you know yourself at a deep level, you begin 
        to understand your core values, purposes, and priorities. You know what is really 
        important to you and what gives you meaning. With this clarity, you know what makes 
        you happy at work and how best to contribute to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        DISCOVERING VALUES AND HIGHER PURPOSE
    
        If you are doing this alone at home, do a Journaling exercise (see Chapter 4) for a few minutes 
        with one or both of these suggested prompts:
        
        •  My core values are…  
        •  I stand for…

        Possible topics of the monologue are:
 
        •  What are your core values?
        
        •  What do you stand for?
        
        After everybody has a chance to speak, have a meta-conversation to talk about what this 
        experience was like for each of you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Envisioning
    
        Envisioning is based on a very simple idea: it’s much easier to achieve 
        something if you can visualize yourself already achieving it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discover Your Ideal Future
 
        In Search Inside Yourself, we teach an envisioning practice similar to what Roz did 
        for herself. The basic idea is to envision, discover, and consolidate our ideal 
        future in the mind by writing about it as if it were already true.

        DISCOVERING MY IDEAL FUTURE

        Consider these questions before writing. In this future:
 
        • Who are you and what are you doing?
 
        • How do you feel?
 
        • What do people say about you?
 
        Let’s spend a minute in silent contemplation before writing.
        (1-minute pause)
        Start writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Questions to consider:
 
        • What is the speaker saying and how is it touching and inspiring you?
         
        • What about the speaker makes you look up to him/her?

        Talk About Your Ideal Future a Lot

        There are two important benefits. First, the more you talk about it, the more real it becomes to you. 
        This works even if your dream is highly improbable or impossible. My own dream, for example, is to
        create the conditions for world peace in my lifetime. I envision a world that is peaceful because 
        inner peace, inner joy, and compassion are widespread, and those qualities are widespread as a 
        consequence of ancient wisdom practices being made accessible to the modern world. 
        The second important benefit is the more you talk to people about your ideal future, 
        the more likely you can find people to help you. This is especially true if your aspiration 
        for the future is altruistic in nature because people will rush to help you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Resilience
 
        Resilience is the ability to overcome obstacles along the way. Alignment and envisioning help you find 
        out where you want to go, and resilience helps you get there.
        We can train resilience on three levels:
         
        1. Inner calm: Once we can consistently access the inner calm in the mind, it becomes the foundation 
        of all optimism and resilience.
         
        2. Emotional resilience: Success and failure are emotional experiences. By working at this level, 
        we can increase our capacity for them.
         
        3. Cognitive resilience: Understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful 
        mental habits help us develop optimism.
         
        Inner Calm
         
        I once asked Matthieu Ricard the most obvious question one can ever ask of the happiest man in the 
        world.The question was: are there ever days when you are not happy?

        Emotional Resilience
 
        Success and failure are emotional experiences. These emotions can give rise to grasping and 
        aversion, which can hold us back and hamper our ability to achieve our goals. We can build 
        upon the foundations of inner calm with practices that help us deal with the emotions involved 
        in success and failure. Like all emotional experiences, success and failure manifest most 
        strongly in our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        MEDITATION ON RESILIENCE
 
        Calming the Mind
         
        Start with 3 deep breaths.
        Bring gentle awareness to the breath, becoming aware of the in and out breaths, and the spaces in 
        between.


        Failure
 
        Let’s now shift gears into an experience of failure for 4 minutes.
        Bring to mind a memory of an event when you experienced a sense of significant failure—not having 
        met your goal, having let yourself and others down. See, hear, and feel it.
        Observe all the associated emotions and see how they manifest in the body.
        (2-minute pause)
        Let us see if we can create the ability to experience all those emotions without aversion.
        Consider these emotions you are experiencing as simply physiological sensations. That is all. 
        They may be unpleasant, but they are simply experiences. Let’s simply allow these experiences 
        to be present, to come as they wish, and to go as they wish. Just let them be, in a kind, gentle, 
        generous way.
        (Long pause)
      </p>
      <p>
        Success
 
        Let’s now have more fun and shift gears into an experience of success for 4 minutes.
        Bring to mind a memory of an event when you experienced a sense of significant success—having 
        exceeded your goal, being admired by all, feeling great about yourself. See, hear, and feel it.
        Observe all the associated emotions and see how they manifest in the body.
        (2-minute pause)
        Let us see if we can create the ability to experience all those emotions without grasping.
        Consider these emotions you are experiencing as simply physiological sensations. That is all. 
        They may be very pleasant, but they are simply experiences. Let’s simply allow these experiences 
        to be present, to come as they wish, and to go as they wish. Just let them be, in a kind, gentle, 
        generous way.
        (Long pause)
        Returning to Calm
        
        Let us now return to the present for 3 minutes. Check in with your body and how it feels now.
        (Pause)
        Take a deep breath and let go. Continue a relaxed attention on breathing and, if you feel so 
        inclined, bring a hand up to rest on the chest.
        (Pause)
        Continue noticing what happens in your body, and slowly open your eyes.
        Thank you for your attention.
    </p>

    <p>

        Learning Optimism, Unlearning Pessimism
 
        Happily, optimism is something that can be learned. Ironically enough, optimism starts with 
        being realistic and objective. We naturally pay much more attention to negative than positive 
        occurrences in our lives. For example, if you’re a writer and out of ten reviews of your work, 
        nine are glowing and one is nasty, chances are you will remember that one nasty review more than 
        the glowing ones. This is also true for other aspects of our lives.
