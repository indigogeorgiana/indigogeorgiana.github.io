          <div class="h2"><strong> What a responsive site?</strong></div>
            <p>
              Simply put, a responsive site is an internet website that is coded and designed to be displayed on any 
              size screen. Because of a technology boost resulting in the increased sale of smart phones more people 
              are using these devices to access the internet. Thus demanding the greater need for responsive websites. 
            </p> 
            <div class="h2"><strong>Why responsiveness important?</strong></div>
            <p>
              Responsive websites are far more flexible and can respond to resizing correctly. Old have some flaws in that
              the websites cannot resize fonts, graphics and content as in smaller screen sizes as result code drops off 
              the screen in unhappy visitors. Also for web developers and designers responsiveness has removed the need 
              for creating two separate websites, and more thought is put into the layout against all platforms.
            </p>               
          <div class="h2"><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</strong></div>
            <p>
             A wireframe is a rough draught or basic layout plan of a webpage, or what it might look like. Kind of like 
             a skeletal three-dimensional model in which only lines are presented. The designers of software frameworks 
             aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to 
             meeting software requirements rather than dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing 
             a working system, thereby reducing overall development time. An example would be a team using a web framework 
             to develop a large website can focus more on writing code rather than the mechanics.
            </p>
            
        <div class="h2"><strong>What mobile first design and Why is mobile first important?</strong></div>
            <p>
             Mobile first design is the process of planning from the smallest screen first, then later working our way 
             up in screen size as the process becomes easier. This strategy works well because a smaller device is usually 
             most difficult to design for. From a usability perspective planning for a smaller screen first is the 
             most logical way forward when planning all content to display on screen.
            </p>
        <div class="h2"><strong>Why I found wireframes difficult to implement?</strong></div>
          <p>
            In the first build of my website I had not planned for a boxifying method. Although 
            we learned a lot about boxifying in this sprint. It had not occured to me why I had choosen to use that 
            my previous method. Boxifying at first is a somewhat very complex and forces one to  try to really understand 
            the mechanics, dimensions how different elements effected the overal layout. But thank the lord, for the red 
            lines, I say they really helped moving me forward. Having spent so much I am still learning to work within 
            its parameters I will have to complete it in my own spare time. I like to know how things really work and 
            I felt the ten hours spent was not enough time for me to get a full grasp.            
          </p>     
        <div class="h2"><strong>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</strong></div>
          <p>
            A framework is a basic structure which provides developers generic like code functionality. 
            That functionality can be altered by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific 
            software. Frameworks also provides a standard way to build and deploy applications. The main concept 
            of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all answer and with familiar code production it will evolve. 
            However, once a framework is learned future projects will become easier and quicker to complete. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Frameworks include things like tool sets, code libraries, and application programming interfaces also known as APIs 
            that bring together all these components to aid in the development of your project. The framework code, in 
            general, is not suppos to be modified. In my understanding users can extend the frameworks, but they 
            really shouldn't modify its code.
