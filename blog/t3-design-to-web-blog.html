          <div class="h2"><strong> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</strong></div>
            <p>
              Simply put, a responsive site is an internet website that is coded and designed so that it can be be displayed 
              on any size screen. Because of a technology boost resulting in the increased sale of smart phones more people 
              are using these devices to access the internet. Thus demanding the greater need for responsive websites. 
            </p> 
            <p>
              Responsive websites are important because they are more flexible and can respond to resizing correctly. Older
              websites cannot do this as fonts, graphics and content drop off resulting in unhappy visitors. For web developers 
              and designers this has removed the need for creating two separate websites as more thought put into the design 
              against all platforms.
            </p>               
          <div class="h2"><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</strong></div>
            <p>
             A wireframe is a rough draught or basic layout plan of a webpage, or what it might look like. Kind of like a skeletal 
             three-dimensional model in which only lines are presented. An image or set of images which are used for planning a site's 
             structure and functionality.  
            </p>
          <div class="h2"><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</strong></div>
            <p>
             Mobile first design is the process of planning from the smallest screen first, then later working our way up in screen size and 
             the process becomes easier. This strategy works well because a smaller device is usually most difficult to design for. Also from 
             a usability perspective planning for a smaller screen first is the most logical way forward when planning all content to display 
             on screen.

          <div class="h2"><strong>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</strong></div>
            <p>
            
            </p>
          <div class="h2"><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why.</strong></div>
          <p>
            As I had not planned my website using a boxifying method first I realised I may have to do this before completing one of the 
            last tasks on my list, 3.1 Build Your Redesigned Site.
