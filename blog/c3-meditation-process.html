    <div class="h2"><strong>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong>
    </div> 
      <p>
          Process over product made perfect sense and was very eye opening. It would have made more impact if this information was 
          placed in Sprint 2. This week I realised I am quiet a visual person, nothing would have stopped me from spending my own 
          personal time tweaking the website. It's like a fidget spinner, I just couldn't leave it alone. I don't think of it was time 
          wasted. In hindsight however I will admit that I could have simplified the website more as and used the box model process 
          we learnt in the Udacity Tutorials. These things alone could have saved me some time in the Sprint 3 re-design.
      </p>
    <div class="h2"><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong>
    </div> 
      <p>
          Lightheartedly, I thought meditation was something Tibetan monks had mastered 
          exceptionally well or something wealthy people did as a part of a self-prescribed wellness 
          regime. It honestly held very little appeal for me personally, or so I thought.
      </p>
      <p> 
          In truth what I did know was that if meditation was honed and mastered correctly, 
          there was some kind of, (well sort of) intangible sense of inner peace, just how it could 
          really be measured I didn’t know. I definitely understood that happiness, mental 
          wellbeing, and an overall outwardly appearance of peace were some of the side effects. 
          What I have come to learn is that there is also a lot more benefits of mindfulness meditation.
      </p>
    <div class="h2"><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong>
    </div> 
      <p> 
          <em>"Slagter’s study showed that after just three months of intensive and rigorous training 
          in mindfulness meditation, participants can significantly reduce their attentional blink. The 
          theory is that with mindfulness meditation training, one’s brain can learn to process stimuli more 
          efficiently, hence after processing the first salient target, it still has the mental resources 
          to process the second."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
          Another study that stood out to was a study by Antoine Lutz showed that 
          Buddhist meditators are able to generate high-amplitude gamma brain waves. Resulting in highly
          effectiveness in memory, learning, and perception.
      </p>
      <p>
          Both of these fact astounded me if by practicing mindfulness meditation there was a marked 
          effect on the brain then what it could do for me? What Dev Academy Bootcamp from my own 
          understand was full-on an experience that would likely challenge my mind intellectually, 
          mental and maybe on some level physically. Preparing myself in advance seemed a sound 
          and worthy cause.
      </p>
    <div class="h2"><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong>
    </div> 
      <p>
          Opened or closed eyes during meditation is optional. That surprised me, so I decided to try it. From my 
          own perspective after trying it I did find the visual sitmulation was distracting. Closed eyes I found 
          kept me focussed and on track. It is my hope that by making mindful meditation a part of my daily 
          routine the least What I could benefit was happiness, increase, higher clarity and I quote 
          <em>"the possibility of upgrading the operating efficiency."</em>
      </p>
    <div class="h2"><strong>Any other musings?</strong>
    </div>  
      <p>
          Honestly, I had not realized just how difficult it would be to turn off my internal dialogue, switch off 
          and practice <em>just being.</em>  Everyday before I have a busy day planned, I could hear the washing 
          beeping at me reminding me it was ready to hung on the line. But I am assured by the writer that 
          it may take some practice and time to manage.
