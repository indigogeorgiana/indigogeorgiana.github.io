        <div class="h2"><strong>Explaining HTML, CSS and DOM to a non-technical friend?</strong></div>
          <ul class="a">
            <li>
              <b>HTML</b> - Known as <b>Hypertext markup language,</b> it is a programming language used 
              for the creating of web pages on the internet. HTML uses unique tags to let the browser know 
              how a webpage should look and display online. These tags are designed to be used as pairs, and 
              there are many different tags. HTML can also be used to add meta information to a web page but 
              is not usually displayed by web browsers. There are many other similar languages such as XHTML 
              which is quite similar but more strict version.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>CSS</b> - <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> is used to format the layout of web pages on the 
              internet and is a way to the design and look of HTML or XHTML web pages. The language was 
              designed by the World Wide Web Consortium and is supported well by most modern web browsers. 
              One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed and understood, even if the CSS
               is not working or removed. 
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DOM</b> - A <b>Document Object Model</b> (DOM) is an application programming interface 
              (API) used for valid HTML. With the DOM, programmers can build websites, add, modify or delete 
              lements and content. Languages like HTML, CSS, and XHTML can be accessed, altered or using the 
              DOM.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <div class="h2"><strong>Building a website is just like writing a book...say what?</strong> </div>
          <ul class="a">
            <p>
              For anyone who has ever written a book (me) they would likely tell you that the above 
              statement is not entirely accurate. However, in my opinion in principal, the basics of 
              writing a book are somewhat similar.
            </p>    
            <li>
              For a best selling book we'll need a book idea and an expert ghostwriter or novelist. In walks 
              our expert Web Developer or depending on the size of the project a team of Web Developers to 
              code and build your website.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>DOM</b> – Writes may need a typewriter, pencil and paper to get started writing a book. Web 
              Developer requires a reliable <b>Document Object Model</b> and  <b> API</b> to build websites.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>HTML</b> - A writer considers a unique and interesting story with characters, descriptions 
              and punchy dialogue are the tools required to write a book. Web Developers need at the very 
              least HTML language and a good set of hands.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>CSS</b> – Similair to a bookcover designer and editors role we’ll need to give our website 
              some snazzy personal touches so to make our website really pop our Web Developer/Designer 
              using <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> language as tool to add colourful images, fresh unique 
              fonts and usable layouts.
            </li>
          </ul>
        <div class="h2"><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></div>
          <ul class="a">
            <p>
              Everything on a website is actually a box wow...that's amazeballs!! Simply put boxifying 
              design is a method of taking everything needed to build a webpage and dividing them into 
              various boxes. Boxifying all content of your webiste is quite a simple method. Before 
              coding your website think first about everything that will be on your website. Grabbing 
              a paper and pencil you can make space for images, text, headers, links and other content.
            </p>
            <p>Some the benefits to using the  boxifying design  concept are:</p>
            <li>
              Makes the developers job easier when he/she is decided where everything is going to go on 
              a web page.
            </li>
            <li>Breaks down a large task into small tasks making it easier for a large team to manage.
            </li>
          </ul>  
        <div class="h2"><strong>What is the box model?</strong></div>
          <ul class="a">
            <p>Given that all elements needed to design a webpage can fit into boxes, as web developer's 
              we are able to define and divde these elemnts within the box model called content, Borders 
              and margins.
            </p>
            <li>
              <b>Border</b> - As per the diagram below the border is the area around the padding and 
              content.
            </li>
            <li><b>Padding</b> - Clears an area around the content.
            </li>
            <li><b>Content</b> - The content of the box, is where text and images will appear.
            </li>
