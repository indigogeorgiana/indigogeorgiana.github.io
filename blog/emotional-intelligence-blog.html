                <div class="h2"><strong>What learnings did you take from chapter one?</strong></div>
                <p>Before reading chapter one I decided to gain some insight into the book and read the forewords of Daniel Goleman and Jon Kabat-Zin. And from the foreword alone I had an understanding of what I was in for. Then I read the first chapter of the book I wanted to continue reading. Seriously, this book really blew my mind in more ways than one. Now personally I like to think of my self as a somewhat well-read person, but after just one chapter of this book, I realized still have much, much more to learn. In short, it opened my eyes to the science of neuroplasticity.</p> 
                <p>Then I remembered someone said something to me the other day, and I quote <em>"the brain needs more space than we give it, but life is fleeting, and sometimes it's hard to force it to shut up." </em>Thanks, Sam honestly, this small nugget of wisdom bounced around in my head for the rest of that day and resonated with me more as I began reading through this book. 
                  Feeling inspired about the possibilities about what I could potentially learn I decided to jot down a list of some of the benefits others had gained in going through their own journey of finishing this book and following the teachings.</p>

                  <ul class="a">
                      <li><b>The ability to:</b></li>
                      <li>An increased level of emotional intelligence</li>
                      <li>Perceive mental and emtional processes with more clarity</li>
                      <li>Aid in better concentration, clarity and awareness</li>
                      <li>A greater self-confidence, self-mastery - to see myself for clearly and kindly</li>
                      <li>Improved family communication</li>
                      <li>Calm yourself on demand</li>
                      <li>Develop a more focussed sense of optimism and resilience</li>
                      <li>Create useful mental habits</li>
                      <li>Learn to uncover your ideal future</li>
                      <li>Motivation: Emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Immediately I realized that not some but all of these benefits above would overflow into other areas of my life. Career by way of completing my learning at Dev Academy and pushing through into a new career path. And in the community through Habitat for Humanity a cause I have decided to really support in the near future.</p>

                <div class="h2"><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></div>
                  <p>This was officially my first attempt at any type of mediation, two minutes of silencing my mind and <em>just being.</em> The notion seemed somewhat foreign, then I took another look at the list I had written out. So, I checked the time before closing my eyes. At first, it was kind of hard at trying to turn off my thoughts but I focussing on just breathing, blocking out the world outside. And the author of the book had warned, <em>when my mind went off track, bring yourself back gently.</em> </p>
                  <p>When I did eventually open my eyes, I had spent almost seven minutes focussing on that one thing, breathing and just being. From my own experience, I found meditation/mindfulness simple and at first a little difficult. I can only imagine how much discipline a person who meditates daily manages this skill. I understand more about the benefits that can be gained from devoting just two minutes a day to mindfulness.</p>
