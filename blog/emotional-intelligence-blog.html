  <div class="h2"><strong>Chapter 1  - Searching inside yourself: The Unexpected Path to Achieving Success, 
    Happiness(and World Peace)</strong>
  </div>
  <div class="h2"><strong>What learnings did you take from chapter one?</strong></div>
    <p>
      Before reading the chapter I decided to speed read through the forewords of Daniel Goleman and Jon Kabat-Zin hoping that it would be 
      beneficial to gain some insight. From the foreword alone I had a breif understanding of what the book was about.
    </p>    
    <p> 
      After reading the first chapter of the book my interest was sparked and I wanted to continue reading. Seriously, the authors and 
      collaborators of this book were really on to something good. Combined with the research they had noted and collected the concept 
      behind their teachings appeared sound. It blew my mind in more ways than one.
    </p>
    <p> 
      Personally, I like to think of my self as a somewhat well-read person, but after just one chapter of this book, I realized how much 
      more there was for me to learn. In short, it opened my eyes to the science of neuroplasticity from a different angle.
    </p> 
    <p>
      Then I remembered something someone had said to me the other day, and I quote <em>"the brain needs more space than we give it. But life 
      is fleeting, and sometimes it's hard to force it to shut up."</em> With that small nugget of wisdom bouncing around inside my head for 
      the next couple days it began to reasonate with me more as I read through this book.  Feeling inspired about the possibilities of what 
      this book could potentially teach me I began jotting down a little list of some of the benefits others had gained through their own 
      experience.
    </p>
  <ul class="a">
    <li><b>List of possible benefits:</b>
    </li>
    <li>an increased level of emotional intelligence
    </li>
    <li>the ability to perceive mental and emtional processes with more clarity
    </li>
    <li>aid in better concentration, clarity and awareness
    </li>
    <li>a greater self-confidence, self-mastery- (to see myself more clearly and kindly)
    </li>
    <li>improved family communication
    </li>
    <li>the skill to calm yourself on demand
    </li>
    <li>develop a more focussed sense of optimism and resilience
    </li>
    <li>create useful mental habits
    </li>
    <li>learn to uncover your ideal future
    </li>
    <li>master motivation - emotional tendencies that guide or facilitate reaching goals
    </li>
  </ul>
    <p>
        <b>Instant lightbulb moment! </b> Almost immediately I realized that all of these benefits 
        could eventually over-flow into other areas of my life. My brain quickly calculated the 
        logic and of what I had read, either the writer was a really good sales person, or 
        they spoke the truth through their own experience at Google. Yes, Google, with a estimated 
        brand value of $245 billion, the same Google who's search engine millions, including myself 
        used on a daily basis. The very same Google where hordes of Web Dev Wannabe's flock to and 
        aspire to work. There was absolutely no doubt this was something for me to explore further. 
        Career changing, life altering, if I did indeed embraced the teachings inside this book.
        I thought more about my life, I Knew I was on to a good with Enspiral Dev Academy, when I
        completed my learning and promote myself into this new career, path what then? What else 
        could I do to better my life, my family and my people. Then I thought about the community aspect 
        going a bit further than myself. Having connected with Habitat for Humanity already, believing in 
        their cause before hand I hopep this could be the way I could geniuinely give back to my community.
    </p>
  <div class="h2"><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong>
  </div>
    <p>
        This was officially my first attempt at any type of mediation, two minutes of silencing 
        my mind and <em>just being.</em> The notion seemed somewhat foreign, then I took another 
        look at the list I had written out. So, I checked the time before closing my eyes. At 
        first, it was kind of hard at trying to turn off my thoughts but I focussing on just 
        breathing, blocking out the world outside. And the author of the book had warned, <em>
        when my mind went off track, bring yourself back gently.</em> 
    </p>
    <p>
        When I did eventually open my eyes, I had spent almost seven minutes focussing on that 
        one thing, breathing and just being. From my own experience, I found meditation/mindfulness 
        simple and at first a little difficult. I can only imagine how much discipline a person who 
        meditates daily manages this skill. I understand more about the benefits that can be 
        gained from devoting just two minutes a day to mindfulness.
