Kia Ora and welcome to my github page, my name is Indigo Phillips.

I have attended and completed the Ensprial Dev Academy 18 Week Bootcamp in Auckland with an awesome diverse group of nine other students known as the Mamaku Cohort of 2018.  This website page is but the humble beginnings of my journey into the much loved world of code.  

My time here at present with an awesome bunch of people is more than just a learning institution. There truly is no other learning expereince like it!! The environment here is built on one of the most unique, ground-breaking and growth driven Information Technology learning environments ever in New Zealand. I still can't believe I am privileged enough to be experiencing this here and now.  

Our mentor/tutor is Don Smith and he is one of the most friendly, passionate and experienced developers I have ever had the honor of meeting. With more than fiften years in information technology, ten years of which was spent with Microsoft, hope I got that one right Don.

If you are thinking of becoming apart of Dev Academy I would recommend it. The people, our support team are warm, funny and inviting. The success of their past graduates is phenomenal in fact past students are encouraged to check in and visit often, and its not hard to see why. It's the atmosphere here! 

A normal day with the emphasis on wellbeing, mindfulness and challenging oneself go hand in hand with the focus on human and team skills is what makes Dev Academy unique.

Your welcome to come along with me on my journey and I look forward to some awesome learning along the way. I am currently working on getting paid work.
