Kia Ora and welcome to my blog page.

My names Indigo and I recent attended and completed the Ensprial Dev Academy 18 Week Bootcamp in Auckland with an awesome and diverse group of students known as the Mamaku Cohort of 2018.  This website page is but the humble beginnings of my journey into the much loved world of code.  

Your welcome to come along with me on my journey and I look forward to some awesome learning along the way. I am currently working on getting paid work.
