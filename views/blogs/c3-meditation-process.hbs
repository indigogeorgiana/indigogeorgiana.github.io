          How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign 
          and rebuild?
        </strong>
      </h3>
        <p>
            Process over product made perfect sense and was very eye opening. It would have made more impact if this information 
            was placed in Sprint 2. This week I realised I am quiet a visual person, nothing would have stopped me from spending 
            my own personal time tweaking the website. It's like a fidget spinner, I just couldn't leave it alone. I don't think 
            of it was time wasted. In hindsight however I will admit that I could have simplified the website more as and used 
            the box model process we learnt in the Udacity Tutorials. These things alone could have saved me some time in the 
            Sprint 3 re-design.

          What did you think about meditation before reading chapter
        </strong>
      </h3> 
        <p>
          Lightheartedly, I thought meditation was something Tibetan monks had mastered exceptionally well or something 
          wealthy people did as a part of a self-prescribed wellness regime. It honestly held very little appeal for me 
          personally, or so I thought.
        </p>
        <p> 
          In truth what I did know was that if meditation was honed and mastered correctly, 
          there was some kind of, (well sort of) intangible sense of inner peace, just how it could 
          really be measured I didn’t know. I definitely understood that happiness, mental 
          wellbeing, and an overall outwardly appearance of peace were some of the side effects. 
          What I have come to learn is that there is also a lot more benefits of mindfulness meditation.

        What new things have you learnt about meditation?

      <p> 
        <em>"Slagter’s study showed that after just three months of intensive and rigorous training 
        in mindfulness meditation, participants can significantly reduce their attentional blink. The 
        theory is that with mindfulness meditation training, one’s brain can learn to process stimuli more 
        efficiently, hence after processing the first salient target, it still has the mental resources 
        to process the second."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another study that stood out to was a study by Antoine Lutz showed that 
        Buddhist meditators are able to generate high-amplitude gamma brain waves. Resulting in highly
        effectiveness in memory, learning, and perception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both of these fact astounded me if by practicing mindfulness meditation there was a marked 
        effect on the brain then what it could do for me? What Dev Academy Bootcamp from my own 
        understand was full-on an experience that would likely challenge my mind intellectually, 
        mental and maybe on some level physically. Preparing myself in advance seemed a sound 
        and worthy cause.

        Opened or closed eyes during meditation is optional. That surprised me, so I decided to try it. From my 
        own perspective after trying it I did find the visual sitmulation was distracting. Closed eyes I found 
        kept me focussed and on track. It is my hope that by making mindful meditation a part of my daily 
        routine the least What I could benefit was happiness, increase, higher clarity and I quote 
        <em>"the possibility of upgrading the operating efficiency."</em>

        Honestly, I had not realized just how difficult it would be to turn off my internal dialogue, switch off 
        and practice <em>just being.</em>  Everyday before I have a busy day planned, I could hear the washing 
        beeping at me reminding me it was ready to hung on the line. But I am assured by the writer that 
        it may take some practice and time to manage.
