    <h3><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        There is defintely I connnection, I could even say in some instances an overlap between emotional 
        awareness, accurate self-assesment and self-confidence. All areas which every human has had to 
        face at some point in their lives. The author of the book describes all three.."simple linear 
        relationship." Linear to me means a series of steps on one long line of a process. Or a move 
        from one stage into another or connected.

      <h3><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, 
        Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          This morning I pracitised the body scan practice and found it to be very beneficial. I found the 
          technique was very good for focus as the book promised. I did have some problem trying to focus in 
          the first few chapters of this book with focus and my internal voice. The exercise took all my 
          attention I found myself repeating the process over in my head many times to remember in what 
          order I needed to focus one. In all it was very enlightening.

    <h3><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        That through mindfulness I can better control my emotions, and most defintely that my emotions are not
        who I am. However upon reflection, I find personally my emotions are apart of who I am and when 
        critizied or struggle with something I tend to search internally more that outside of myself in 
        times of doubt. This is not something I have always done, but something, I have learned how to best 
        navigate myself through past relationships and friendships. Silence is sometimes golden, pause, think,
        then respond.
