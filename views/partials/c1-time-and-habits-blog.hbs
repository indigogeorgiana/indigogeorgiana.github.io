      <h3><strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Pormodoro sounded quiet promising because I wanted to see what I could achieve without the 
          distractions or interuptions from family members. So I decided to treat the next 30 mins like a 
          experiment to find out if my mind would drift or lose focus engaged with the amount of reading 
          and information put before us in the this sprint.

    <h3><strong>What did you find interesting?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        What I found interesting is one, I should always study on a Monday to Friday while the children 
        are at school. Two that my mind didn't feel as inundated with code or all the stresses and I 
        could quiet my mind and focus at the one task at hand. I felt a little more clearer and restful and 
        not so stressed about completing this sprint. I knew that I would complete it.

    <h3><strong>What worked for you?</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Locking the bedroom door defintely worked to minimise some distration. While Reading through the 
        various pieces of information I found the articles on the habits of successful the idea of starting 
        small. Luckily, having started this cohort with 8 extra weeks up my sleeve this allowed me plenty 
        of time to really focus and concentrate unhurriedly on the tasks before me. I have found personally 
        steping back from study for a few days has helped me alot. Moving forward on the following Monday 
        I quickly formulated my future approach on Phase zero.

      <h3><strong>Which will you experiment further with?</strong></h3> 
      <p>
        I would defintely like to attempt meditation, reading through the information I also had never 
        knew about the benefits.  It taught me alot about myself my strengths and weaknesses, I like the 
        idea having a mind of clarity in todays world and as a mother of three is easy to forget the 
        importance of sanity, unplugging and taking time for yourself.  I also liked the youtube video 
        about forget big change, start with a tiny habit. Ten different ways to celebrate, the energy 
        and the ideolgy of the presenter and the message he was trying to convey.
